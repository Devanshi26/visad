This the java source for a netcdf implementation.
It is composed of two packages, ucar.multiarray and
ucar.netcdf. Sources may be found in multiarray and
netcdf respectively. There is also a test in the
unamed package whose source is in tests/TestNetcdf.java.

We are still figuring out how to do release engineering of
for java source releases.  I don't know how to do it.
Don't expect the Makefiles to work for you without extensive editing.
DO NOT use the docs target, it was designed to use polardoc,
and this distribution contains docs generated using jdk1.2 javadoc
which would be overwritten.
I use the SGI cosmocode IDE, so I'm not using the Makefiles.

You should also have classes in ../../classes.
You will need to add that directory, in its fully
qualified form, to your CLASSPATH.

Refer to the html documentation in ../../docs
to navigate the package.

Enjoy.
