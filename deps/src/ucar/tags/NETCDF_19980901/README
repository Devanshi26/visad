This the java source for a netcdf implementation.
It is composed of two packages, ucar.multiarray and
ucar.netcdf. Sources may be found in multiarray and
netcdf respectively. There is also a test in the
unamed package whose source is in tests/TestNetcdf.java.

This release (September 1998) includes a drop in replacement
for RandomAccessFile which is buffered, speeding up the NetcdfFile
implementation. There is improved string support in MultiArray,
and rmi classes in ucar.netcdf.

The web site for updates and news about this package is
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/java

We are still figuring out how to do release engineering of
for java source releases.  I don't know how to do it.
Don't expect the Makefiles to work for you without some editing.
I use the SGI cosmocode IDE, so I'm not using the Makefiles.

You should also have classes in ../../classes.
You will need to add that directory, in its fully
qualified form, to your CLASSPATH.

Refer to the html documentation in ../../docs
to navigate the package. This was generated using the
jdk 1.2 beta version of javadoc.

Enjoy.
