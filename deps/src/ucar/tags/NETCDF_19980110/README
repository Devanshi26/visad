This the java source for a netcdf implementation.
It is composed of two packages, ucar.multiarray and
ucar.netcdf. Sources may be found in multiarray and
netcdf respectively. There is also a test in the
unamed package whose source is in tests/TestNetcdf.java.

This is our first attempt at distributing java source.
I don't know how to do it. Don't expect the Makefiles 
to work for you without extensive editing. I use the SGI
cosmocode IDE, so I'm not using the Makefiles.

You should also have classes in ../../classes and
html documentation in ../../docs. Refer to the documentation
there to navigate the package.

The files netcdf.patch and multiarray.patch are
used by the 'make docs' to get links to the class overview
documents into the polardoc generated html documentation.

Enjoy.
