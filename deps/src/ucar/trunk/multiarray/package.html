    <TITLE>UCAR MultiArray API Overview</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
Provides an abstraction for multidimensional array 
access, some concrete implementations, and ways to view a MultiArray
as if it had a different structure. The MultiArrayProxy 
and IndexMaps provide techniques to make any MultiArray appear as if
it were transposed, flipped, flattened, clipped, sliced,
subsampled, or any composition of these.
</P>

<P>
In the following, we 
use the unadorned term &quot;array&quot; to mean the Java language 
construct, and the term &quot;multidimensional array&quot; for the
mathematical abstraction modeled by the MultiArray class in 
this package.</P>
<P>
A <I>multidimensional array</I> is a collection of elements that are 
accessed by <I>index</I>. The elements may be objects or primitives. 
The index is a one dimensional array of integers. The number of 
dimensions of a multidimensional array is called its <I>rank</I>. Each 
of the dimensions has a length, which determines the possible values of 
the corresponding index element. A multidimensional array of rank 1 is 
often referred to as a <I>vector</I>. A multidimensional array of rank 
0 is referred to as a <I>scalar</I>.</P>
<P>
Like C and C++, the Java programming language provides an array
primitive which is actually a (fixed length) vector. Also like C and
C++, this primitive is used in the language to build up
multidimensional arrays as vectors of vectors. For example, a two
dimensional M by N array would be constructed as a vector of M
references to M vectors each of length N. This strategy wastes some
storage, and the waste increases for higher dimensioned arrays. In
random access patterns, the added level of indirection for each
dimension incurs a performance penalty as well. Numerical programs in
C or C++ often avoid direct use of the language construct for
multidimensional arrays. The availability of pointers and pointer
arithmetic can be used to trade off against the costs, but these
features are not available in Java. This suggests a need for Java
library classes that abstract the notion of multidimensional array and
implement commonly used array operations. These are included in this
 package.</P>
<P>
The MultiArray API consists of:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    <A HREF="MultiArrayInfo.html"><B>MultiArrayInfo</B></A><B>
     Interface </B>- A reflection or introspection interface for 
    multidimensional arrays. Methods to discover the rank, shape and 
    component type. 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="Accessor.html"><B>Accessor</B></A><B>
     Interface</B> - Methods to set and get single values of a 
    multidimensional array. Also methods for aggregate copy in and out of 
    the array. 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="MultiArray.html"><B>MultiArray</B></A><B>
     Interface</B> - The union of MultiArrayInfo and Accessor 
    interfaces. This is the interface that client code should use. The 
    artificial factorization into MultiArrayInfo and Accessor interfaces is 
    only needed for the convenience of some implementations, notably 
    ucar.netcdf.Variable. 
    <LI>
    <B>MultiArray Implementations</B>- Wrappers for Java arrays (<A
     HREF="ArrayMultiArray.html">ArrayMultiArray</A>) 
    and scalar objects (<A HREF="ScalarMultiArray.html">ScalarMultiArray</A>), 
    as well as a space efficient implementation (<A
     HREF="MultiArrayImpl.html">MultiArrayImpl</A>). 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="IndexIterator.html"><B>IndexIterator</B></A><B>
     utility class</B> - Used to step through the possible index 
    values. 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="MultiArrayProxy.html"><B>MultiArrayProxy</B></A><B>
     / <A HREF="IndexMap.html">IndexMap</A> Interface 
    Framework</B> - MultiArrayProxy uses an IndexMap to provide a 
    different view of some MultiArray. The new view typically has a 
    different structure than the backing MultiArray. For example, we may 
    wish to reduce the rank by one, fixing the index for a given dimension 
    at a specific value. 
    <LI>
    <B>Concrete IndexMap classes</B> - Concrete IndexMap primitives 
    that are used with MultiArrayProxy to <A
     HREF="SliceMap.html">slice</A>, <A
     HREF="ClipMap.html">clip</A>, <A
     HREF="DecimateMap.html">subsample</A>, <A
     HREF="FlipMap.html">flip</A>, <A
     HREF="TransposeMap.html">transpose</A>, or <A
     HREF="FlattenMap.html">flatten</A> a MultiArray. 
    These may be functionally composed to form complex operations by using 
    nested construction. 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="AbstractAccessor.html"><B>AbstractAccessor</B></A><B>
     abstract class </B>- A partial implementation of the Accessor 
    Interface that handles primitive type conversions. 
    <LI>
    <A HREF="StringCharAdapter.html"><B>StringCharAdapter</B></A><B>
     class</B> - An adapter for MultiArray of <TT>char</TT> component 
    type that presents a MultiArray of String interface. 
</UL>
<P>
The MultiArray methods to get() and set() values operate on single 
values. To grab a slice, clipped region or some other aggregate out of 
a MultiArray, use MultiArrayProxy and the appropriate concrete 
IndexMaps to create that view of the MultiArray. The concrete 
MultiArrayImpl provides a copy constructor for which the view can be 
used as initializer. The copyin() and copyout() methods of MultiArray 
may also be used for simple clippings.</P>
<P>
There is an example program, <A
 HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/java/examples/DemoMultiArrays.java">DemoMultiArrays.java</A>, which 
shows some ways to use the interface.</P>
