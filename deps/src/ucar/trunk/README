This the java source for a netcdf implementation.
It is composed of two packages, ucar.multiarray and
ucar.netcdf. Sources may be found in multiarray and
netcdf respectively. There is also a test in the
unamed package whose source is in tests/TestNetcdf.java.

Although the code only references jdk1.1.x classes,
and can be run in jre1.1.x environments, you will
need the 'rmic' compiler in jkd1.1.7 or jdk1.2 to
create the remote stubs.

This release (October 1998) includes fixes to the
RemoteNetcdf implementation. Some visible changes
to the class hierarchy were necessary to accomplish this.
A subinterface ucar.multiarray.RemoteAccessor was added,
and the class ucar.netcdf.RemoteAccessor was renamed
to ucar.netcdf.RemoteAccessorImpl.  Thanks to Michael McCarrick
for his testing of the RemoteNetcdf code.

We alse dropped the 'final' designation on class ucar.netcdf.NetcdfFile.

Since September 1998 we have included a drop in replacement
for RandomAccessFile which is buffered, speeding up the NetcdfFile
implementation. There is improved string support in MultiArray,
and rmi classes in ucar.netcdf.

We are still figuring out how to do release engineering of
for java source releases.  I don't know how to do it.
Don't expect the Makefiles to work for you without some editing.
I use the SGI cosmocode IDE, so I'm not using the Makefiles.

You should also have classes in ../../classes.
You will need to add that directory, in its fully
qualified form, to your CLASSPATH.

Refer to the html documentation in ../../docs
to navigate the package. This was generated using the
jdk 1.2 beta version of javadoc.

Enjoy.
