This is a list of issues that I didn't have time to finish so far. It's by no means complete.

General
-------
- Add a help manual and add some help information for components. 
- Add some other functions, e.g. plot, bookmark...

ECHOSearch
----------
- Functionalize spatial search.
- Add temporal search.
- Add getURL() function when it's ready.

GCMDSearch
----------
- Separate different searches similarly to ECHO (Id, Keywords; Hierarchy-category, topic...; Spatial).
- Add spatial search interface (copy from ECHO).
- Change hierarchy search to browsing. 
- (From before)There should probably be a better way to input search strings using boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc...


DatasetList
-----------
- There should probably be a better way to input search strings using boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc...

This is a list of issues that I didn't have time to finish
before I stopped working on the project.  It's by no means complete.

URL List
--------
- The user shouldn't be allowed to select both a URL and an Inventory.
- The user shouldn't be allowed to apply a CE to URLs from multiple 
  inventories.
- There should probably be some sort of check to make sure a CE can
  actually be applied to a URL.

GCMDSearch
----------
- There should probably be a better way to input search strings using
  boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, etc... 
- Browsing would be nice, but that would be a rather large undertaking.

DatasetList
-----------
- This should load datasets.xml from the web somewhere.  It shouldn't be
  hard to implement in the code, but will require putting the datasets.xml
  in some central location (this may already have happened, but if it did
  I don't know where to look).

Inventory
---------
- Deal with negative date ranges.

DodsImport
----------
- It might be nice to seperate the URLList and the main panel with a 
  JSplitPane.
