This package contains the DODS Test Server (DTS).
These classes contain specific types for building a DODS Server
that is designed as a test platform for the core server code, and 
as a means of testing clients. This server will attempt to 
server data from ANY valid DODS DDS. The server opens the DDS,
and in response to a client request for data fills the DDS with
INVENTED data and returns it to the client. See the implementations
of the various types to see what the invented should look like when
recieved by the client.
