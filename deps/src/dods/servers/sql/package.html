</HEAD>
<BODY>
This package contains the DODS Relational Databse Server (DRDS).
These classes contain specific types for building a DODS Server
that forwards client data requests to a SQL Relational database
via the JDBC interface. Because of the (unusual) nature of this
exchange, some of the core server code (ServerDDS, CEEvaluator)
need to be subclassed to place the JDBC functionality into 
the code.
<p>
The <code>DODSServlet</code> and it's children rely on the 
<code>javax.servlet.ServletConfig</code>
interface (in particular the <code>getInitParameter()</code> method)
to retrieve the name of a .ini file containing information
about where to find extensive configuration information used by
the servlet. Alternate methods for establishing this functionality
can be arranged by overloading the method <code>loadIniFile()</code>
<p>
The information for making the JDBC connection should be located in this 
<code>iniFile</code> object that is inflated by the <code>doGet()</code>
method of the parent class <code>DODSServlet</code>. The section in the 
iniFile should look like:

<pre>
[JDBC]
Driver            =    the.name.of.the.jdbc.driver
ConnectionURL     =    jdbc:somevendor://targetmachine:port
username          =    guest
password          =    
MaxResponseLength =    300
</pre>
