<BODY>
This package contains the DODS ASCII client. These classes are used directly 
(via the class factory asciiFactory) by the DODServlet class to provide the 
ASCII response from a DODS Server. The class implementations contain the 
logic for flattening the complex DODS data structures into columns of comma 
delimited ascii text.
