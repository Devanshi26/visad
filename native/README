Getting Native Code
===================
The VisAD native code can be obtained from:

    ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad/visad_native.jar


Building Native Code for Applications
=====================================
Although VisAD is a pure Java system, applications of VisAD
may include native code.  The reality is that most science
code is still written in Fortran.

The applications in `visad/paoloa`, `visad/paoloa/spline`,
`visad/aune` and `visad/benjamin` also include native code in
both C and Fortran.

Edit the Makefile in the `visad/paoloa`, `visad/paoloa/spline`,
`visad/aune` and `visad/benjamin` to change the path:
 
  JAVADIR=/opt/java
 
to point to the appopriate directory where you installed Java.

On systems that support Unix make, change to each of
the directories `visad/paoloa`, `visad/paoloa/spline`, `visad/aune`
and visad/benjamin run `make`.  This will create the shared
object files (i.e., file names ending in ".so") containing
native code.  To run these applications make sure that your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes ".", change to one of these
directories::

  /parent_dir/visad/paoloa
  /parent_dir/visad/paoloa/spline
  /parent_dir/visad/aune
  /parent_dir/visad/benjamin

and run the appropriate `java ...` command.

Note that the applications in `visad/paoloa` require data files
available from::

  ftp://ftp.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad/paoloa-files.tar.Z


Building Native Code for the HDF-EOS and HDF-5 File Adapters
============================================================
Although VisAD is a pure Java system, it does require native
code interfaces in its adapters for HDF-EOS and HDF-5 file
formats.  We believe that the need for these will disappear
as the organizations supporting these file formats develop
Java interfaces.

The HDF-EOS and HDF-5 file adapters include native interfaces
(JNI) to file interfaces written in C.  To make the HDF-EOS
VisAD native library on systems that support Unix make,
change to the `visad/data/hdfeos/hdfeosc` directory and run
`make all`.

Note that the native code in visad/data/hdfeos/hdfeosc does
not include NASA/Hughes' HDF-EOS C file interface code; it
only includes our C native code for creating a Java binding
to their HDF-EOS C file interface.  You must obtain the
HDF-EOS C file interface code directly from NASA and NCSA.
To do this, please follow the instructions in::

   visad/data/hdfeos/README.hdfeos

We have successfully linked these libraries on Irix and
Solaris.

Native interfaces can be obtained from:

  	http://www.hdfeos.org/software/library.php
	http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/JNI/

Before you can run applications that use the HDF-EOS and
HDF-5 file adapters, you must add::
 
  /parent_dir/visad/data/hdfeos/hdfeosc

and::

  /parent_dir/ncsa/hdf/hdf5lib
 
to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
