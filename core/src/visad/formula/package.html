Provides an interface for automatically evaluating formulas based on
user-defined operators and functions.

The VisAD formula package is accessed through the FormulaManager class.
The constructor for the FormulaManager class takes user-defined operators,
operator precedences, and functions as arguments.  Then, variables can be
bound to pre-existing ThingReferences with the FormulaManager.createVar()
method, bound to formulas with the FormulaManager.assignFormula() method,
or set directly with the FormulaManager.setThing() method.

The FormulaManager.getThing() method returns the current value of a
variable, and the FormulaManager.remove() method deletes a variable.

Variables update automatically when the variables upon which they depend
change.  For an example of usage, see the visad.ss package.
