To install VisAD-in-a-Box:

1) From the distribution directory, run
   'install_visad'
2) Answer the few installation questions,
   then wait for everything to finish
   installing.

(Note: Cluster installation is done using
 the 'cpush' utility.)

To create a new VisAD-in-a-Box distribution:

1) Create a distribution directory.
2) Copy visad/install/install_visad to the
   distribution directory
3) Copy a visad.jar file to the distribution
   directory.
 a) If you have a VisAD source distribution,
    you can run 'make compile' (or 'make recompile')
    to compile all the VisAD sources, then run
    'make classes' to create visad.jar in the
    directory about the Makefile.
4) Optionally, copy a JDK directory tree into
   the distribution directory and name it
   jdk-<OS>-<MACH> where <OS> is whatever is
   printed by 'uname -s' and <MACH> is whatever
   is printed by 'uname -p'.
5) Move to the directory about the distribution
   directory and package everything up with
   'tar cvf visad' (or whatever you've named
   your distribution directory.
