To install VisAD-in-a-Box:
1) If you've received an install_visad.tar file,
   run 'tar xvf install_visad.tar'
1) Move into the extracted distribution directory
   and run 'install_visad'
2) Answer the few installation questions,
   then wait for everything to finish
   installing.

(Note: Cluster installation uses the 'cpush' utility.)

To create a new VisAD-in-a-Box distribution:

1) Create a distribution directory.
2) Copy visad/install/install_visad to the
   distribution directory
3) Copy a visad.jar file to the distribution
   directory.
 a) If you have a VisAD source distribution,
    you can run 'make compile' (or 'make recompile')
    to compile all the VisAD sources, then run
    'make classes' to create visad.jar in the
    directory about the Makefile.
4) If you want to include Java executables, you can
   do either of the following:
 a) Copy a JDK directory tree into the distribution
    directory and name it jdk-<OS>-<MACH> where <OS>
    is whatever is printed by 'uname -s' and <MACH>
    is whatever is printed by 'uname -p'.

    If you do this, the included 'java' executable
    will be used to run the installer.
 b) Package up a JDK directory tree in a jar file
    named jdk-<OS>-<MACH>.jar (where <OS> and <MACH>
    are as in (a) above.
5) In the directory above the distribution, package
   everything up with 'tar cvf visad.tar visad' (or whatever
   you've named your distribution directory.
