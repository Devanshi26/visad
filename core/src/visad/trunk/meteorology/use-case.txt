Goal in Context

    The goal is to allow the user to display atmospheric soundings
    on a thermodynamic diagram and to interact with the sounding to
    deepen understanding of the sounding and atmospheric thermodynamic
    concepts.

Scope and Level

    Summary Use Case

Preconditions

    Sounding(s) to be displayed have been identified and are ready to be
    displayed.

Successful End Condition

    User goes away with a deeper understanding of the sounding and/or
    the relevant atmospheric thermodynamic concepts.

Failed End Condition

    User goes away pissed.
