<h2>Enabling QuickTime in VisBio</h2>
</center>
<p>
Support for reading and writing QuickTime files is built into VisBio, but it
requires that you have QuickTime for Java installed on your machine.
<p>
If you do not have QuickTime installed, first visit
<b>http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/</b> and install it. When prompted,
choose to do a Custom installation. Be sure you choose to install QuickTime
Essentials, QuickTime Internet Extras, and QuickTime for Java, since VisBio
requires them.
<p>
After QuickTime has been successfully installed, choose Options from VisBio's
File menu to bring up the VisBio options. Check the "Enable QuickTime"
checkbox and follow the instructions. Once QuickTime is enabled within VisBio,
you'll be able to open QuickTime movies, as well as export them.
