<h2>The Align Tab</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Align tab contains functions for adjusting the data's units, and provides
alignment functions to correct for cell drift and other undesirable phenomena.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>How VisBio proportions its displays</b></font>
<p>
By default, VisBio scales data according to the image dimensions. Thus, a
512 x 512 x 10 dataset (that is, a stack of ten 512 x 512 images) would appear
to be square, with the ten slices distributed evenly, so that the 3-D display
remains cube-shaped.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Providing data dimensions in microns</b></font>
<p>
If the data is known to be differently shaped, this information can be entered
by checking "Use microns instead of pixels," entering the length and width (in
microns), and providing the distance (in microns) between each slice. VisBio
will then display the data proportioned accordingly.
<p>
If "Use micron information for Z-scale" is unchecked, VisBio will disregard
the "Microns between slices" value when proportioning the 3-D display's Z
dimension, instead defaulting to the standard behavior of attempting to make
the display as close to a cube as possible.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Drift correction basics</b></font>
<p>
Often times, behavior within a specimen is of interest, but movement (or
"drift") of a specimen itself is not. To make measuring such intra-specimen
activity easier, a set of anchor points can be placed at each timestep, and
VisBio can use these points to realign the data properly at each timestep.
<p>
If you plan to use drift correction with your data, it is recommended that you
set up the alignment before beginning your analysis. Once you have set the
alignment, several other functions (in particular, standard measurements and
arbitrary slicing) will take advantage of it automatically.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>How to use drift correction</b></font>
<ol>
<li>Check the "Drift correction" checkbox while viewing the first timestep of
your data. You will see a triangular shape (the "alignment triangle") appear
in the 3-D display. The three endpoints of this triangle are the anchor points
that will be used to align the data across time.
<p>
<li>By dragging the right mouse button, set the three anchor points to mark
three areas of your data that are present at each timestep. For many specimens,
three distinct points along the cell membrane work well (as long as the cell
itself is not changing size or shape).
<p>
<li>Now switch the drift correction mode to "Adjust orientation" and advance to
the second timestep. Move the three anchor points to match the same areas of
your data that you marked before. Note that moving the red point may cause
the yellow and blue points to move as well, moving the yellow point will
keep the red point fixed but may move the blue point, and moving the blue
point will alter neither the red nor yellow points. This behavior happens
because while the alignment triangle's orientation is allowed to change
between timesteps, its size and shape must remain constant.
<p>
<li>Advance to the third timestep and once again adjust the anchor points.
Repeat this procedure for each remaining timestep.
<p>
<li>Once you have set the anchor points at each timestep, switch the drift
correction mode to "Apply alignment to data." The alignment triangle will
disappear, and your alignment settings will be locked in.
<p>
<li>Return to the first timestep and place a measurement line by choosing
"Add line" from the measurement tab. Select the line in the 2-D display (by
clicking it), then set the line as standard (by choosing "2-D standard" or
"3-D standard" from the measurement tab). As you advance through each
timestep, you will notice that the line has been automatically adjusted to
compensate for the specimen's drift!
