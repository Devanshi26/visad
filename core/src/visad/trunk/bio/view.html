<h2>The View Tab</h2>
</center>
<p>
The View tab contains functions for altering how data gets displayed, and for
manipulating those displays.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>The 2-D display</b></font>
<p>
VisBio has a 2-D display for showing the current slice at the current timestep.
If arbitrary slicing is enabled, the 2-D display shows the current arbitrary
data slice.
<p>
To toggle the visibility of the 2-D display, check or uncheck the "2-D"
checkbox. Use the Zoom and Reset buttons to the right of the checkbox for
adjusting the display's zoom factor. In addition, SHIFT + right mouse drag
along the 2-D display also adjusts zoom. Lastly, CTRL + right mouse drag
translates (pans) the data within the display.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>The 3-D display</b></font>
<p>
VisBio has a 3-D display for showing the stack of slices at the current
timestep. It supports the same functions as the 2-D display. In addition,
dragging the right mouse button rotates the display, and the white bounding
box can be toggled using the "3-D bounding box" checkbox.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>The previous/next displays</b></font>
<p>
When low-resolution thumbnails are created (see the "Overview" tab), the
thumbnail data can be used to present a view of the timesteps immediately
preceeding and following the current one. To toggle these displays, check or
uncheck the "Previous/next displays" option.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Resolution controls</b></font>
<p>
When low-resolution thumbnails are created (see the "Overview" tab), the
displays can be toggled between full resolution and low resolution. To switch
to full resolution view, click the "Hi-res" button. The full resolution data
may need to be loaded from disk, so be patient. To switch to low resolution
view, click the "Lo-res" button.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Animation</b></font>
<p>
To animate at an acceptable rate, low-resolution thumbnails must be created
(see the "Overview" tab for more detail). To toggle animation, push the
"Animate" button. If "Auto-switch resolutions" is checked, the display will
reflect the highest resolution available at each timestep. Otherwise, the
resolution will stay at its current setting during animation. Note that
animating in Hi-res mode with "Auto-switch resolutions" turned off will
result in poor performance.
<p>
Also, animation of arbitrary slices at fast speeds is practical if the slice
resolution is set low enough (see the "Arbitrary data slicing" section), but
animation of rendered volumes is slow (less than one frame per second), because
the volume must be computed on the fly at each timestep (see the "Volume
rendering" section).
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Volume rendering</b></font>
<p>
To render the image stack as a semi-transparent volume, check the "3-D volume
rendering" checkbox. The resolution of the volume can be adjusted using the
associated slider. Note that volumes greater than 64 x 64 x 64 begin to consume
many megabytes of memory to render (hence the upper bound of 128 x 128 x 128).
Lastly, the opacity of the volume can be adjusted using the "Transparency"
slider on the color tab.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Arbitrary data slicing</b></font>
<p>
The image stack can be sliced at an arbitrary angle, creating a new slice that
gets displayed in the 2-D view. To enable arbitrary slicing, check the
"Arbitrary data slice" option. A semi-transparent cutting plane will appear in
the 3-D window, with three anchor points defining its location. Drag these
anchor points with the left mouse button to alter the position of the arbitrary
slice.
<p>
The resolution of the slice can be adjusted using the associated slider. The
lower the resolution, the faster the slice will be computed (allowing for fast
on-the-fly animation of the slice), but the blockier it will look.
<p>
Normally, the slice is recomputed each time you release the left button after
dragging an anchor point. By checking the "Update slice continuously" option,
the slice will instead be recomputed as the anchor points are dragged, creating
a more interactive feel. However, keeping this feature enabled when the slice
resolution is high may result in extreme sluggishness.
