<h2>The Color Tab</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Color tab contains functions for adjusting the data's color properties.
Most color controls require clicking the "Apply" button at the bottom of the
color tab to finalize the changes. Note that for very large datasets,
recomputing color properties can take several seconds.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Brightness and contrast</b></font>
<p>
Image brightness and contrast can be adjusted with the brightness and contrast
sliders, respectively.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Range components</b></font>
<p>
Data in VisBio has one or more range components. That is, at each pixel, there
may be one or more associated values. Often, there will be only one range
component (such as <i>intensity</i>, representing the intensity at that pixel),
although some data may have three range components (such as <i>red</i>,
<i>green</i> and <i>blue</i>, representing the red, green and blue values for
that pixel, respectively). Data collected with multi-spectral imaging
techniques may even have 32 or more range components!
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Color models</b></font>
<p>
VisBio supports two color models: RGB and HSV. In the RGB color model, the
color space is divided into the components <i>Red</i>, <i>Green</i> and
<i>Blue</i>, representing the levels of red, green and blue present at each
pixel, respectively. In the HSV color model, the color space is divided into
the components <i>Hue</i>, <i>Saturation</i> and <i>Value</i>, where hue
represents a value along a color continuum (similar to a rainbow), saturation
represents how saturated each pixel is with that color (the less saturated,
the whiter the pixel will be), and value represents the brightness of each
pixel (the less the value, the blacker the pixel will be).
<p>
Select the RGB radio button to use the RGB color model, or select the HSV radio
button to use the HSV color model.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Range component color mappings</b></font>
<p>
Range components from the data can be mapped to one or more color components.
For example, data with one range component, <i>intensity</i>, could have
<i>intensity</i> mapped to <i>Red</i>, <i>Green</i> and <i>Blue</i>, producing
a standard grayscale image. For data with three range components, the natural
mapping is to map the first component to <i>Red</i>, the second to <i>Green</i>
and the third to <i>Blue</i>, fully representing the data in the RGB color
space.
<p>
VisBio will attempt to guess at good range component mappings when data
is first loaded, but in some cases, adjustments may be necessary to achieve the
desired visualization. In particular, when the data has more than three range
components, you will probably want to choose which range components to map to
which color components for greatest effectiveness.
<p>
To map a range component to a color component, choose the desired range
component from the color component's drop-down menu. For example, to map
<i>intensity</i> to <i>Red</i>, choose <i>intensity</i> from the drop-down
menu labeled <i>Red</i>.
<p>
At times, it may be useful to fully saturate a color component, or completely
empty a color component. To zero out a color component, choose <i>None</i> from
that component's drop-down menu. To max out a color component, choose
<i>Full</i> instead.
<p>
Lastly, you may wish to display a composite of all range components. By
enabling "Composite image coloring," all range components are mapped to a
color continuum known as "pseudocolor," then averaged, so that each pixel
represents a composite of all its range components.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Adjusting volume rendering opacity</b></font>
<p>
When volume rendering is enabled from the view tab, the slider labeled
"Transparency" becomes available. This slider adjusts the opacity of the
rendered volume. By moving the slider to the right, the volume becomes more
opaque, whereas moving the slider to the left causes the volume to become more
transparent.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Range component color tables</b></font>
<p>
Each range component has an associated color table that fully represents its
mapping into the color space. To view this color table, choose the desired
range component from the drop-down menu above the color table. The displayed
color table and color range will change to represent the chosen range
component.
<p>
By changing brightness, contrast, range component mappings and other options,
you will see the changes reflected in that range component's color table.
However, complete control over each color table is available if needed. To
modify a color table directly, drag the left mouse button across to the table
to modify the active color component level at different range values. Click the
right mouse button to cycle through active color components, from <i>Red</i> to
<i>Green</i> to <i>Blue</i> to <i>Alpha</i> (opacity) and back to <i>Red</i>.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Color scaling</b></font>
<p>
Each range component has a range of values. By default, VisBio assumes the
minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 255. That is, a range component
value of 0 corresponds to the leftmost color in its color table, whereas a
range component value of 255 corresponds to the rightmost color in the table.
<p>
Of course, it may not be the case that a particular range component conforms
to this assumption. Thus, minimum and maximum range values can be manually
specified for each range component by typing them into the appropriate text
boxes after checking the "Fixed color range" option. Alternately, VisBio will
compute these bounds automatically if "Fixed color range" is unchecked.
