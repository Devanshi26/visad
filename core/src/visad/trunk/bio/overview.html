<h2>VisBio Overview</h2>
</center>
<p>
Welcome to VisBio, a tool for visualization and analysis of 4-D multispectral
data (stacks of slices of biological data with multiple color values, animated
across time). It's more fun than a backpack full of angry weasels.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>How to import a dataset</b></font>
<p>
The first step is to load your dataset into VisBio. From the file menu, choose
Open. A dialog box will appear:

<p>
The most straightforward way to get a time series into VisBio is to number your
data files across time. For example, the sample <i>C. elegans</i> dataset
available on the VisBio web site is a collection of 13 files labeled SDUB1.PIC
through SDUB13.PIC. For this dataset, you'd fill in "C:\data\SDUB" for the file
prefix (where "C:\data" is the location of the dataset), "1" for Start, "13"
for End, and "PIC" for Extension.
<p>
You can fill in the fields manually, or you can let VisBio fill in the fields
automatically by clicking the "Choose file" button and selecting one timestep
in your dataset. So, you could select any one of the SDUB files using the file
chooser, and VisBio would automatically detect that there are 13 timesteps in
the series.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>How animation works in VisBio</b></font>
<p>
To save memory, VisBio only keeps one timestep of the dataset in memory at a
time, thus allowing visualization of huge datasets quickly. Unfortunately, when
you switch timesteps, VisBio would need to load the new timestep into memory
from disk, which takes time and slows down animation.
<p>
To sidestep this problem, VisBio reads in all timesteps one at a time when
it first imports the dataset. It creates a low-resolution thumbnail of each
slice of every timestep, keeping all these thumbnails in memory at once.
<p>
VisBio has a "lo-res" mode and a "hi-res" mode. In lo-res mode the thumbnail
is displayed, whereas in hi-res mode the timestep is loaded from disk. When
you switch timesteps, VisBio uses lo-res mode by default to avoid the
slowdown of going to disk for the next timestep. Thus, animation is still
quick.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Controlling low-resolution thumbnailing</b></font>
<p>
Since the thumbnails' memory footprint is much smaller than it would be at
full resolution, VisBio gives you the best of both worlds--efficient memory
use and realtime animation--at the expense of a longer initial loading time.
<p>
You can specify the thumbnail resolution by altering the values next to the
"Create low-resolution thumbnails" checkbox when first importing a dataset
(the default is 64 x 64 pixels). Making these numbers smaller will result in
the low-resolution mode looking blockier but taking less memory, whereas
larger numbers will require more memory to store the thumbnails but look
crisper while animating.
<p>
You can also choose to disable low-resolution support completely by unchecking
the checkbox. When thumbnails are disabled, the dataset will load more quickly
(VisBio only needs to load the current timestep instead of loading them all
and profiling them), but animation will be disabled as well, and switching
timesteps will be slow since the new timestep must be loaded from disk.
