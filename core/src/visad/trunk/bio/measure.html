<h2>The Measure Tab</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Measure tab provides functions for measuring aspects of the data by
placing lines and markers on and across data slices.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Basic measurement controls</b></font>
<p>
To add a measurement line, click the "New line" button. To add a measurement
marker, click the "New marker" button.
<p>
To select a measurement, click on it. Selecting multiple measurements is
accomplished by holding SHIFT while clicking, or by holding SHIFT and dragging
a rectangle over the measurements to select. Selected measurements have yellow
endpoints, and selected lines appear dashed instead of solid. To unselect all
measurements, click the left button on an empty area of the display. Note that
in the current version of VisBio, measurements can be selected only in the 2-D
display.
<p>
Once a measurement is selected, many of its properties can be altered. It can
be removed by clicking the "Remove" button, its color can be changed using the
"Color" drop-down box, its measurement group can be changed using the "Group"
drop-down box (see the "Measurement groups" section), and it can be set as
standard (see the "Standard measurements" section).
<p>
Lastly, to remove all measurements and start from scratch, click the "Clear
all" button. A dialog will appear asking you to confirm your choice.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Measurement groups</b></font>
<p>
A measurement group is a simple way to classify and group measurements. Each
measurement can belong to a group with associated title and description. For
example, if you use markers to label cell nuclei, you could make a group called
"nuclei" by clicking the "New" button next to the "Group" drop-down box,
provide a group description by typing it into the "Group description" text
area, and assign each measurement to that group accordingly.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Standard measurements</b></font>
<p>
A measurement can be set to exist on multiple slices or timesteps. Such a
measurement is said to be "standard." A "2-D standard" measurement exists on
every slice of every timestep, whereas a "3-D standard" measurement exists only
once at every timestep (and not necessarily on the same slices at each step).
<p>
For example, suppose you wish to measure the diameter of a cell membrane at
every slice of every timestep of your data. Place a line measuring the diameter
at the first slice of the first timestep, then select it. Choose "2-D standard"
to convert the measurement to a 2-D standard line. Then, proceed through each
slice of each timestep, adjusting the line to match the cell membrane
appropriately.
<p>
Standard measurements are particularly useful because they are represented in a
special format when exported (see the "Exporting measurements" section).
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Exporting measurements</b></font>
<p>
To export the list of measurements to a tab-delineated text format appropriate
for import into a spreadsheet program such as Excel, click the "Export
measurements" button. In this file, standard measurement values will appear in
a table format, and single measurements will appear as a list at the bottom.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Merging measurement endpoints</b></font>
<p>
The endpoints from multiple measurement lines can be merged, so that dragging
the merged endpoint adjusts all linked lines accordingly. To merge endpoints,
click the "Merge" button. After being clicked, the button will appear
highlighted. Then, hold SHIFT and drag a rectangle across all endpoints to be
merged. All endpoints within this rectangle will be combined into a single
endpoint.
