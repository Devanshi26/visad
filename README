Building
========
There are 4 main build files (the old visad/build.xml has been removed).
The main build file `./build.xml` can be used to build the sub-projects
and create the man VisAD distribution files. Each sub-project also has 
it's own build file that can be used to perform basic build/clean/jar
operations for just that project.

You can use `ant -p` to display build script target descriptions
for each ant file for more information.

Building the Distribution
-------------------------
Check out https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/visad
Run `ant dist`

Building the Core
----------------------
You can either work from the entire SVN tree (https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/visad/trunk)
or check out only the core (https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/visad/trunk/core).

From your working copy you can simply run any of the commands listed by `ant -p`.

If you jar the core it will extract `lib/visaddeps.jar` and include the class files
in the generated visad.jar.

Building the Examples
---------------------
You can either work from the entire SVN tree (https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/visad/trunk)
or check out only the core (https://svn.ssec.wisc.edu/repos/visad/trunk/).

The examples project build file check to see if VisAD is available as either a jar file
in the exmples project lib directory or in ../core (assuming you checked out all of 
visad/trunk). If it cannot find VisAD it attempts to call ../core/build.xml to build
it before compiling the examples.  If you have VisAD in another location you can compile
the examples as follows::

    ant -Dvisad.dir=<YOUR VISAD DIR> build
